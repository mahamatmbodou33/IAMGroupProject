## IAMGroupProject
AWS Identiy and Access management(IAM) is an AWS Service securely control access to your AWS resources in your organition. It ensures the right in an organization can only access the service that they need to perform their task. It enhances security of your resource in the cloud, and it is part of the best security Practice.

## Project Overview
In this project, I am going to create IAM groups with  specific access policies aligned with each group's functions.There would be three groups: Admin, Developer and Tester. Each group has three or more users. There would be one user like DevaOps exists in two groups based on his function. 
### AdminGroup: John, Mahamat, and Sara
